# Python Scrips for VirusTotal

One of my experiments is to compare the classifier with the 54 antivirus
supported by VirusTotal. These scripts aim to upload files and retrieve
reports to VirusTotal automatically, making your life easier.

## Dependencies

All the scripts are written in Python. To keep dataset well-organized,
a database management system (DBMS) is necessary. Therefore, PostgreSQL
and its Python adapter Psycopg2 are chosen. Poster is also needed since
the Python standard library do not provide a simple way to upload files
via HTTP.

* Python 2.7
* Psycopg
* Poster

## The Basics

There are three major limitations on VirusTotal: 
1. Maximum file size: is 128MB. However, uploading a file over 50MB may causes HTTP 413, which means the request entity is
too large.



```sql
CREATE TABLE apps (
  a_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  a_name VARCHAR,
  a_path VARCHAR,
  a_vt_sha256 VARCHAR,
  a_vt_report JSON
);
```
