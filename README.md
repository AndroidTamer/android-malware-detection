# Android Malware Detection

My research is about Android malware detection. This repository provides
APIs and scripts for static analysis. Most of the codes are written in
Python for rapid development.


## Suggested Development Environment

* Ubuntu 14.04
* PostgreSQL 9.3.5
* Python 2.7.6

Two additional python modules, `psycopg` and `poster`, are needed for
database manipulation and uploading files via HTTP. Use `apt-get` to
install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-poster
```


## Overview

The workflow of static analysis is simple as most of machine learning
applications: acquire a dataset, extract features, and classify the 
samples.

### Dataset Acquisition

There are several ways to get APK files. You can download them either from 
[Google Play][1] or from thrid-party app stores like [Wandoujia][2]. Extra
tools may be needed to download APK files from Google Play such as
[APKs Downloader][3]. Note the daily quota of a Google account is about 300
to 500 APK files. It takes over a month to collect ten thousand apps by a
single account.

After downloading, we should label the APK files as malicious or benign.
Some papers trust all the samples from Google Play as benign, and use the
malicious dataset provided by [Android Malware Genome Project][5].
However, this scheme is too coarse since malicious applications may exist
in Google Play. Google Bouncer is not almighty.

[VirusTotal][4] is another common way to do this job. It provdes a public
API to scan arbitrary files online by several anti-virus scanners. A paper
[Drebin][6] labels the applications as malicious that are detected by at
least two of the ten common scanners, and combines them with
[Android Malware Genome Project][5]. Another paper [MAMA][7] controls the
detection ratio of all the scanners empirically.
