# Android Malware Detection

My research is about Android malware detection. This repository provides
APIs and scripts for static analysis. Most of the codes are written in
Python for rapid development.

## Suggested Development Environment

* Ubuntu 14.04
* PostgreSQL 9.3.5
* Python 2.7.6

Two additional libraries, `psycopg` and `poster`, are needed for database
manipulation and uploading files via HTTP. Use `apt-get` to install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-poster
```
